### To-Do List, since theres alot features and security measures left to add

1. Find a safe way to store/access the basic user/password account for the MySQL database, since for now it is still in plaintext.

2. Add a confirm Button for the delete function

3. Improve design, since this was all created by Hand using bulma css instead of using a template, there is much to improve.

4. Reverse Note Order (showcase more recent notes on top)

5. Implement specific cancel buttons on modals instead of only offering the standard X to exit on the top right

6. Implement a search function
